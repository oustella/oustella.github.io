Thoughts from today's podcast No Stupid Questions: 
Are you a thinker, a doer, or a charmer in this world? People with a combination of all three are rare. On the other hand, we are not singular entities. Lives are meant to spend on mastering different subjects. To be a good researcher, one needs to know how to use the whole toolbox: having a good idea, designing a study, executing the study, collecting the data, analyzing the data, writing up the results, getting rejected for publications, and rewriting. I think I have a tendancy to be a thinker, wanting to be able to envision the whole story from beginning to end before writing down one word. Thoughts without actions are, well, just thoughts. It applies to both good and bad thoughts.
