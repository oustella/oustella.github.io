      Use your whole senses to do one thing. 
      
      Don’t create burden to your tasks by adding distractions. 
      
      If you are running, you want to hear your breath, not the music that can give you a headache. 
      
      If you are eating, don’t watch TV, which makes you forget what you are eating. 
      
      Being in the moment gives you the most satisfaction.
    </p>

      Don't estimate what it is that you do.
      
      If something is worth doing, it is worth doing it poorly. (Because doing it poorly is still better than not ever doing it.)

      Tomorrow is a disease.

      If you want to do something, honey, do it, at least start it, to-day.

          Studies show that optimistic thinking without preparation to match lowers people's chance of actually
          achieving
          what they have in mind. It is better to anticipate the potential problems and plan accordingly while
          maintaining
          a positive outlook.

              Notes from <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/apolo-ohno/">The Knowledge Project Ep. 90</a> <br>

              Enjoy the process of pushing yourself to the extreme, know that you really have given it all, and have the
              satisfaction that you have left nothing on the table. There is not one drop of energy left in you in
              pursuing what you set your eyes on. Give your dream its proper dues. <br>

              People who are at the top of the population in performance are often focused and singular to a fault. They
              put one thing on their mind and don't care about anything else. They may even hurt others' feelings for
              being aggressive and competitive in achieving their goal. Being singularly focused may not be the best
              approach to life and it is implied that the mentality may be short-lived. However, it is probably the
              fastest way of achieving a goal. <br>

              Ohno talked about how his sports psychologist helped him spot his tendancy to deteriorate really fast and
              give up the whole game as soon as a small imperfection in performance appears. His self-sabotaging also
              shows up when he intentionally falls behind and tests to see if he can still make it. He is lucky to have
              recognized that is his cause of self-sabotaging in his teen years and was able to overcome that tendancy
              and
              later became a great athlete.

                Notes from <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-virtue-signaling/">NSQ Ep. 17</a> <br>

                Are you a thinker, a doer, or a charmer in this world? People with a combination of all three are rare.
                On
                the other hand, we are not singular entities. Lives are meant to spend on mastering different subjects.
                To
                be a good researcher, one needs to know how to use the whole toolbox: having a good idea, designing a
                study, executing the study, collecting the data, analyzing the data, writing up the results, getting
                rejected for publications, rewriting, and repeat. <br>

                I am a visual thinker. Often, before putting things into words, an image has appeared in my head.
                Sometimes, grand mountains, sands, and icebergs in bright colors appear right in front of me in my
                dreams.
                <br>

                Thoughts without actions are, well, just thoughts. The bright side is, it applies to both good and bad
                thoughts. I spend a lot of time trying to map the whole story from beginning to end before writing down
                one word. That can hinder my ability to act, in fact, it does. The trick to turning thoughts into
                actions
                is to reduce the friction. Think about what is stopping you from taking the leap. Is it mental or
                physical? Know that a humble beginning is the start of many great things. The first draft of a
                manuscript
                is more likely to be horrible than perfect. But pat yourself on the back that, hey, you started it, and
                now you can keep building on it. Physical barriers are usually those easy to solve as long as you take
                actions. Building infrastructure (e.g. automated process of data collection) takes time but it makes you
                more efficent at what you do.
