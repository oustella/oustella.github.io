  Notes from <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-virtue-signaling/">NSQ Ep. 17</a> <br>

  Are you a thinker, a doer, or a charmer in this world? People with a combination of all three are rare. On the other hand, we are not singular entities. Lives are meant to spend on mastering different subjects. To be a good researcher, one needs to know how to use the whole toolbox: having a good idea, designing a study, executing the study, collecting the data, analyzing the data, writing up the results, getting rejected for publications, rewriting, and repeat. <br>
  
  I am a visual thinker. Often, before putting things into words, an image has appeared in my head. Sometimes, grand mountains, sands, and icebergs in bright colors appear right in front of me in my dreams.  <br>
  
 Thoughts without actions are, well, just thoughts. The bright side is, it applies to both good and bad thoughts. I spend a lot of time trying to map the whole story from beginning to end before writing down one word. That can hinder my ability to act, in fact, it does. The trick to turning thoughts into actions is to reduce the friction. Think about what is stopping you from taking the leap. Is it mental or physical? Know that a humble beginning is the start of many great things. The first draft of a manuscript is more likely to be horrible than perfect. But pat yourself on the back that, hey, you started it, and now you can keep building on it. Physical barriers are usually those easy to solve as long as you take actions. Building infrastructure (e.g. automated process of data collection) takes time but it makes you more efficent at what you do.

    Notes from <a href="">The Knowledge Project</a> <br>

    Enjoy the process of pushing yourself to the extreme, know that you really have given it all, and have the satisfaction that you have left nothing on the table. There is not one drop of energy left in you in pursuing what you set your eyes on. Give your dream its proper dues. 
  
    People who are at the top of the population in performance are often focused and singular to a fault. They put one thing on their mind and don't care about anything else. They may even hurt others' feelings for being aggressive and competitive in achieving their goal. Being singularly focused may not be the best approach to life and it is implied that the mentality may be short-lived. However, it is probably the fastest way of achieving a goal. 

    Ohno talked about how his sports psychologist helped him spot his tendancy to deteriorate really fast and give up the whole game as soon as a small imperfection in performance appears. His self-sabotaging also shows up when he intentionally falls behind and tests to see if he can still make it. He is lucky to have recognized that is his cause of self-sabotaging in his teen years and was able to overcome that tendancy and later became a great athlete.
